# AGENTS — Skill Orchestration Controller

Agent orchestration for a multi-discipline engineering, DevOps, and compliance workspace.

## How This Workspace Works

- `skills/` — Skill protocols. Each `SKILL.md` is a self-contained, tool-agnostic specialization: frontmatter `name` + `description`, pre-flight checks, core protocols, output schema, and guardrails. **Skills are the primary interface. When in doubt, invoke the skill.**
- `agents/AGENTS.md` — This file. Routes requests to the right skill and enforces shared execution discipline. Linked systemwide into each tool's config directory (e.g. `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md`), not as a project-level file.
- `standards/technical_standards.md` — Cross-cutting standards (security, knowledge sources, git discipline) every skill inherits.

## Working Path Discipline (non-negotiable)

All edits MUST happen in the version-controlled source, never in symlink targets or runtime directories. Two repos govern this workspace:

| Artifact | Edit ONLY in | Never edit in |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skills, task agents, `AGENTS.md`, `link_resources.sh` | `/home/papanito/Workspaces/papanito/ai-skills/` | `~/.omp/agent/skills/`, `~/.omp/agent/agents/`, `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` (symlinks) |
| Dotfiles (nvim, home-manager, omp config, etc.) | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/` (chezmoi working directory) | `~/.config/` (chezmoi target — read-only at runtime) |

Symlinks from `link_resources.sh` and `chezmoi apply` make runtime locations mirror the source. Editing a symlink target silently breaks the link or gets overwritten on the next apply. **Always edit the source and let tooling propagate.**

## Routing Table

Match the request to a skill by intent. Use the `description` field as the trigger signal. When a request spans multiple domains, invoke each relevant skill and synthesize — do not blend their protocols into one.

| If the request is about… | Route to skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repeatable tasks, "can this be a loop?", done-rules, autonomous agent loops, Loop Training Mode | Spawn the `loop-orchestration` task agent (pinned to `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`) which loads `skills/loop-orchestration-engineer/SKILL.md`. For light lookups, the skill may be read directly without spawning. |
| Starting a project — finding the real goal, small compartmentalized specs, success criteria, second-AI verification | Spawn the `spec-driven` task agent (pinned to `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`) which loads `skills/spec-driven-initiation-engineer/SKILL.md`. For light lookups, the skill may be read directly without spawning. |
| NixOS, declarative config, Flakes, Nix store, module services, rollbacks | `skills/nixos-linux-specialist/SKILL.md` |
| Neovim / LazyVim, `lazy.nvim` plugin specs, Lua, LSP/DAP for cloud-native langs | `skills/lazyvim-expert/SKILL.md` |
| Terraform / HCL, module engineering, provider abstractions, Registry patterns | `skills/terraform-platform-engineer/SKILL.md` |
| Packer, golden images, Kickstart/Preseed, Cloud-init, bake-vs-fry | `skills/packer-imaging-expert/SKILL.md` |
| GitHub Enterprise Cloud on ghe.com, EU data residency, IAM, audit streaming | `skills/github-ghec/SKILL.md` |
| Swiss law (Federal/Cantonal), Fedlex, BV, OR, ZGB, cantonal regulations | Spawn the `swiss-law` task agent (pinned to `google/gemini-2.5-pro`) which loads `skills/expert-in-swiss-laws/SKILL.md`. For light lookups, the skill may be read directly without spawning. |

## Execution Discipline (always apply)

1. **Route first.** Identify the matching skill before answering. If no skill fits, answer as a generalist — do not force a mismatched protocol.
2. **One skill per domain.** For multi-domain requests, run each skill's pre-flight check and output schema independently, then merge only at the final synthesis.
3. **Honor every skill's pre-flight check.** If a skill mandates a STOP-and-ask step (e.g., unknown Canton, unknown flake status, unverified residency claim), enforce it before proceeding.
4. **Shared standards.** All skills inherit `standards/technical_standards.md` — no hardcoded secrets, least privilege, primary-source knowledge first.
5. **Honesty over fluency.** If a skill says "I don't know / Verification Required," surface that. Never fabricate to keep the loop moving.
6. **Producer ≠ verifier.** For any skill with a verification step, the agent that produces the work never self-certifies — route the final check to a fresh context.
7. **Commit on completion.** After finishing a task, if the workspace is a git repository (`.git/` exists), commit the changes following the Git Commit Discipline in `standards/technical_standards.md` (§3). In summary: detect pre-commit hooks, determine commit message format from commitlint config → existing pattern → Conventional Commits fallback, stage only task-related files, and verify with `git status` before committing. Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.

## Two Special Orchestration Modes

These two skills are meta-skills that govern how *other* work gets done. Recognize when the user is asking about *process*, not content:

- **`spec-driven-initiation-engineer`** runs *before* execution: interview for the real goal, decompose into small specs, verify decisions, define done-rules. If the user is about to start a project, route here first.
- **`loop-orchestration-engineer`** runs *after* a task is proven repeatable: audit the workspace, rank candidates with the 4-Condition Test, bake the done-rule + verifier + retry cap + memory into one Orchestration Skill, and manage the Loop Training Mode toggle. If the user asks "can this be automated / looped / run on its own?", route here.

The natural lifecycle is: **spec-driven initiation → manual execution → loop orchestration**. The first produces a verifiable spec; the second proves the work repeats; the third turns it into an autonomous loop.
